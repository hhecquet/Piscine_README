During the one-month 42 Piscine, I worked day and night to learn the fundamentals of the **C programming language** (and a bit of shell scripting as well). Although I had previously studied some C years ago, I had to start over from scratch — even re-learning how to write a simple `main` function.

Despite the intensity, I successfully completed 12 out of the 16 days of projects, as well as one rush project. The experience was incredibly demanding, but equally rewarding. I learned a lot about problem-solving under pressure and how to write clean, efficient C code within strict constraints.

One of the most valuable aspects of the Piscine was the collaborative environment. _Everyone was in the same situation_ — sleep-deprived, confused, and determined — and I truly learned how to communicate effectively, support my peers, and stay motivated as a team. It taught me not just technical skills, but also resilience and adaptability.
